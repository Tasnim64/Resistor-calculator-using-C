# Resistor-calculator-using-C
A C-based resistor calculator quickly deciphers resistor characteristics, such as resistance value (ohms), tolerance (percentage), and temperature coefficient (if applicable), based on the input color code and band count (3, 4, 5, or 6). Ideal for engineers and hobbyists, this tool simplifies resistor selection and usage in electronic projects.
